  <h1>Me and the Bicycle</h1>
  <p>
    I still remember the first time I saw it. It was old, a little rusty, and the paint was chipped in places—but to me, it was beautiful. 
    A <span class="highlight">bicycle</span> that felt like it had a story of its own.
  </p>

  <p>
    I didn't have much. But every time I looked at that bike, I felt a dream growing quietly in my chest. I imagined riding down the hill near my home, the wind 
    brushing against my face, the world flying by as if nothing could touch me. I wanted that more than anything.
  </p>

  <p>
    It took weeks of saving, skipping snacks, and doing small chores for neighbors. Finally, the day came. I handed over the coins, one by one, to the man who 
    had kept it for me. He smiled, maybe because he knew what it meant.
  </p>

  <p>
    The first ride was wobbly. I fell more than once. My hands were scratched, my knees bruised—but my heart? It was full. That bike became more than just a way 
    to get around. It became my escape, my freedom, my little piece of happiness in a noisy world.
  </p>

  <p>
    Even now, when I pass by the place where I used to ride, I remember that feeling. The simple joy of holding onto something I worked for. The quiet lesson 
    that sometimes, the smallest things—like an old bicycle—can carry our biggest dreams.
  </p>

  <p class="highlight">
    It wasn’t just a bike. It was a memory, a friend, and a symbol of who I was becoming.
